        <h3>Little about me</h3>
        <article>
          I am 22 years old. I am a very energetic, focused and commited
          individual. I have many goals in my life, the most important being to
          make my parents proud and provide them all the hapiness of the world.
          <p>
            I liked computers when I was in primary school. Always wondering how
            they work. Now, my degree helped me to understand the gift of
            technology and science. I try to learn as many new things as I can.
            The most learning I have gained is from my degree but I have also
            learned from youtube and other documentation available freely on
            internet.
